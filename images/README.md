The goal of this project is to build an **multi-page Power BI dashboard** that helps stakeholders explore key business insights in real time.  
It gives a clear view of overall performance, revenue trends, occupancy, and booking behavior — all in one place for easy decision-making.  
Below are the snapshots showing different pages and features of the dashboard.
